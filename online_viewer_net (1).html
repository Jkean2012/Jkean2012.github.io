        <p style="text-align:center">This website was made to allow me to submit some of my assignments through coding them. This website has no trace of games and can be used as an educational resource this website is updated everyday and will have ads soon due to the cost of hosting and management. Github has free hosting but we pay for other servers to keep everything running smoothly.</p>
