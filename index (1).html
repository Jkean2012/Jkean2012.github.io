        <p style="text-align:center;">*you may have to scroll down to see the full page*</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">What are three facts about pendulums? </h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">• One fact about pendulums is they swing under the influence of gravity<br>• Another fact about pendulums is that they are used to measure the acceleration of gravity.<br>• One last fact about pendulums are that they lose energy due to wind resistance and friction</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">What are three facts about thermal energy?</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">• One fact about thermal energy is that another name for thermal energy is heat energy<br>• Another fact about thermal energy is thermal energy can be transferred from one object to another<br>• One last fact about thermal energy is that is is created by the acceleration of it's molecules</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">What are three facts about friction? </h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">• One fact about friction is that it is caused by two surfaces moving in opposite directions<br>• Another fact about friction is that friction slows an object down and it eventually stops completely<br>• One last fact about friction is that is generates thermal energy</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">What powers a pendulums movement?</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Gravity powers a pendulums movement.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">What energy conversion happens when it moves?</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">When a pendulum moves potential energy is being converted to kinetic energy and kinetic energy is being converted into potential energy</p>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">What makes the pendulum stop?</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Friction makes the pendulum stop</p>
