        <h1>Summer Reads: Bikes & Boards - Bicycles</h1>
        <h1>3 Important Details from the Text:</h1>
        <p> 1. People in england named it the penny-farthing because it reminded them of two English coins
<br>2. A little over 100 years ago, three inventions led to bicycles like those of today. 
<br>3. The invention of hollow metal frames meant that bicycles were no longer as heavy</p>
<h1>2 Questions: 
Use Question Matrix
</h1>
<p>1. How did bikes change the way humans travel today?   
<br>2. Why did they allow for bicycles to be used if so many were killed?
</p>
<h1>Four things that Square with your thinking
</h1>
<p>1. Changes were made to make bicycles easier and safer to ride 
<br>2. Bicycles were modified to allow children to be able to ride them safely
<br>3. The first bicycles did not look like the bicycles we had today  
<br>4. Bicycles were deadly back in the day and a bump in the road killed many.  
</p>
<p>Note: Square with your thinking means, things that you knew already that were confirmed by the activity/reading.</p>
